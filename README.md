# ExtendedProne_TTE
Code for the Extended Prone Positioning Target Trial Emulation
In this emulation we used a covariate balancing propensity score to create stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. These weights were then used in weighted Cox and Fine and Gray regression models. 
Needed R packages are included in the R markdown file.
